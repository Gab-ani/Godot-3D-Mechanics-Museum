Mechanics Museum will be a little flexing project of mine, it will contain several features built on top of my 3d character controller architecture template.

The second branch is dedicated to make characters aerial less static. I'll quickly show several ways to turn and move the character in midair state, but ultimately, this chapter is a mess. The point is we want to deeper process WASD inputs in midair, but then stumple upon the wish to use it in jump ups and landings as well. As this project is planned as lower-side quality content, I will stop here. The theme of the next episode is tracking, ie the ability to process WASD inputs during animations that lock input at least partially and inconsistently during the lifecycle. There I'll create a generalised practice to manage WASD better for any state we want to, and make some small changes to the jumps again. But not on the algos side, on the refactoring one, so I still consider this an episode worthy piece.
