Mechanics Museum will be a little flexing project of mine, it will contain several features built on top of my 3d character controller architecture template.

4Th episode is funny, almost nothing have been changed in code, I only added another action for a heavy attack input into our proto-weapon. However, the leap is noticable to say humble. I didn't get enough fascinated comments about the Move and Combo framework synergies. Maybe it's just me being noone, but I think people in general didn't feel the depth of the system, don't see it's potential without demostration. So I've returned with demonstration). I've created seven godawful animation assets for greatsword strikes, people, who have eyes, I'm sorry. But thats for speed purposes, and what I did next is I mixed them into a graph of combo flow that can produce five different strikes series of 3+ hits. It has two enters, several branchings and branch merges. (I'll add a picture of Moves graph later)
